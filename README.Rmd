# ItemRest <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-brightgreen" align="right" />

**ItemRest** is an R package developed to automate item removal strategies in Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA).  
It helps researchers identify low-quality items using statistical criteria and simulate the impact of different removal combinations on the factor structure and internal consistency of the scale.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Automatically identifies cross-loading and low-loading items based on customizable thresholds.
- Tests all possible combinations of flagged items.
- Reports explained variance, Cronbachâ€™s alpha, and factor loading range for each solution.
- Highlights optimal strategies with no cross-loading items.
- Built on top of `psych`, `GPArotation`, `EFAtools`, and `qgraph` packages.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Install the package directly from GitHub using the `devtools` package:

```r
# First install devtools if not already installed:
install.packages("devtools")

# Then install ItemRest from GitHub:
devtools::install_github("ahmetcaliskan1987/ItemRest")

```

## Example

# Load the library
library(ItemRest)
# We will use the 'bfi' dataset from the 'psych' package for a realistic example.
# This requires the 'psych' package to be installed.
# The 'bfi' dataset contains responses to 25 personality items.

# 1. Prepare the data: Select the personality items (first 25 columns)
#    and remove rows with missing values for this example.
data(bfi, package = "psych")
example_data <- bfi[, 1:25]
example_data <- na.omit(example_data)

# 2. Run the item removal analysis.
#    Based on theory, the Big Five model has 5 factors.
#    Let's run the analysis with n_factors = 5.
results <- itemrest(
  data = example_data,
  n_factors = 5,
  cor_method = "pearson" # Data is not ordinal, so pearson is appropriate
)

# 3. Print the report for optimal strategies.
#    This will show the final table after the analysis is complete.
print(results, report = "optimal")
