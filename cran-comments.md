## Resubmission

This is a resubmission of the ItemRest package (version 0.2.3).

I have addressed all the points raised by the reviewer, Konstanze Lauseker, in the previous submission. In summary:

* A co-author has been added to the `DESCRIPTION` file.
* References have been added to the `Description` field.
* All exported functions now have detailed documentation (`@return`, `@examples`).
* `cat()` calls have been replaced with `message()` in the main computation function.
* The vignette has been rewritten as a proper step-by-step guide in English.

The package passes `R CMD check --as-cran` with 0 errors and 0 warnings. The only remaining NOTE is about "New submission," which is expected.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
